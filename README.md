1. Run `ingest.py` to create local data lake for 2019 and 2020 taxi data
```bash
python3 ./ingest.py
```

2. Update ~/.dbt/profiles.yml
```yml
taxi_rides_ny:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    # DuckDB Development profile
    dev:
      type: duckdb
      path: taxi_rides_ny.duckdb
      schema: dev
      threads: 1
      extensions:
        - parquet
      settings:
        memory_limit: '2GB'
        preserve_insertion_order: false

    # DuckDB Production profile
    prod:
      type: duckdb
      path: taxi_rides_ny.duckdb
      schema: prod
      threads: 1
      extensions:
        - parquet
      settings:
        memory_limit: '2GB'
        preserve_insertion_order: false

# Troubleshooting:
# - If you have less than 4GB RAM, try setting memory_limit to '1GB'
# - If you have 16GB+ RAM, you can increase to '4GB' for faster builds
# - Expected build time: 5-10 minutes on most systems
```
